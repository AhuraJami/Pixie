Pixie is a cross-platform library that aims to provide a complete suite of development tools for building simplistic virtual environments suitable for developing and testing new and wild Reinforcement Learning algorithms.

Pixie's immediate goal is to provide an easy-to-use and minimalist interface that resembles the logical use of reinforcement learning in real work applications. The final product made by Pixie is meant to be easily ported to Python.

# Getting Started

Pixie is still under active development. I will provide a complete guide once the core is shaped.

# Contribution

Contributions are always welcome. You're welcome to study the code, open an issue, share your ideas and submit a pull request. Just make sure that your contribution complies with the coding style of Pixie. I will complete this section and provide a detailed guide once the core is formed.
